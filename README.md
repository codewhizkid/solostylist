## Chapter 1: Vision & Brand Promise

"Build your brand. Book your clients. Be Simply Independent."

Simply Independent is an all-in-one booking and branding platform designed for independent stylists. It combines powerful appointment management tools with a personalized website creation flow, enabling stylists to become their own brand â€” with zero technical overhead.

The Problem It Solves:
- Stylists waste hours managing scattered tools.
- DIY website builders are overwhelming.
- Booking platforms feel generic, not personal.

Simply Independent provides:
- A beautiful client-facing booking page
- A stylist dashboard to manage bookings, clients, and services
- Branding tools (logo, colors, font, imagery) baked into onboarding

Our Voice: Modern. Confident. Empowering. Simple.
